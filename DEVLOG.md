# Development Log

## Entry 1: Project Initialization & Time Domain (Dec 30, 2025)
Started the "Spectral-Provenance" project. 
- **Goal:** Detect Deepfakes using audio signal processing.
- **Current Status:** Built the basic ingestion pipeline using `librosa`.
- **Key Learning:** Learned about the Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem. We use 22.05kHz to optimize for speech synthesis models.
- **Next Steps:** Researching Fourier Transforms and the Mel Spectrogram to move from measuring Time to measuring Frequency.
